# Minecraft-Classic-0.30-Creative-src
This is the source code for Minecraft Classic 0.30, specifically the Creative mode variant. The source code for the Survival mode variant is no different from this one; the main difference is the change in game modes, that's literally it. I see no point on uploading the Survival variant of this source code.
