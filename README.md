# Minecraft-Classic-0.30-Creative-src
This is a decompiled source code for Minecraft Classic 0.30, specifically the Creative mode variant. The source code for the Survival mode variant is no different from this one, the main difference is the change in game modes; that's literally it. I see no point of uploading the Survival variant of this source code.
